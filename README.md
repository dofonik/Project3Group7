## Overview

We aim to analyze the happiness index of each country and its correlation with various socio-economic indicators. Happiness is a crucial measure of societal well-being, and understanding its relationship with factors such as birth rate, GDP, gross tertiary education enrollment, life expectancy, physicians per thousand people, unemployment rate, urban population, and tax revenue can provide valuable insights into the overall quality of life and societal progress. By examining these interconnections, we can uncover valuable insights into how socio-economic factors influence happiness levels across different countries.

The datasets for our analysis are the World Happiness Report 2021 which reviews the state of happiness in the world, and the Global Country Information Dataset 2023 which tracks various metrics of different countries.

## Instructions

## Ethical Considerations

Privacy - We have chosen a dataset in which there is no personal data presented as to not breach the privacy of participants partaking in the survey. The Gallup World Poll has taken great care to obtain consent from participants of the survey. Thus, we have ensured that the data is anonymised and aggregated appropriately to prevent identification of individuals.

Subjectivity - We have considered the potential for our dataset to be biased due to the methods with which happiness is measured and the subjectivity of happiness itself in different cultures. Instead of imposing a singular definition of happiness, the World Happiness Report uses an individualistic approach to determining happiness set by the participants themselves. This helps account for cultural nuances and aims to present a nuanced understanding of happiness that transcends cultural boundaries.

"We use observed data on the six variables and estimates of their associations with life evaluations to explain the variation across countries. They include GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and corruption. Our happiness rankings are not based on any index of these six factors – the scores are instead based on individuals’ own assessments of their lives... Life evaluations from the Gallup World Poll provide the basis for the annual happiness rankings. They are based on answers to the main life evaluation question. The Cantril Ladder asks respondents to think of a ladder, with the best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a 0. They are then asked to rate their own current lives on that 0 to 10 scale. The rankings are from nationally representative samples over three years." - https://worldhappiness.report/about/

Bias/Representativeness - It is important to determine if our dataset is derived from survey numbers large enough to provide an accurate estimate of overall population happiness in each country where participants were surveyed. In this case, the World Happiness Report boasts 95% confience intervals for its data (https://worldhappiness.report/faq/).
